# Indie Game Developer's Blog: Building "Healing Spirit" with Rust and Bevy

Welcome to my blog, where I share my journey as an indie game developer building an open-world story RPG called "Healing Spirit" using Rust and the Bevy game engine. In this blog, I'll be sharing insights, tutorials, and code snippets from my development process.

As an indie developer, I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and resources with the community. Through these blog posts, I aim to provide valuable information and code examples that can help fellow game developers in their own projects.

## About "Healing Spirit"

"Healing Spirit" is an old-school RPG that takes players on an open-world journey as a Cleric in a Fae realm.

## Why Rust and Bevy?

I chose to develop "Broken Spirit" using Rust and the Bevy game engine for several reasons:

1. **Performance**: Rust is known for its impressive performance and memory safety, making it an excellent choice for game development. It allows me to create a fast and efficient game engine that can handle the complexity of an open-world RPG.

2. **Expressiveness**: Rust's expressive syntax and powerful abstractions enable me to write clean and maintainable code. This is crucial for a large-scale project like "Broken Spirit," where code organization and readability are essential.

3. **Bevy Engine**: Bevy is a modern and flexible game engine that seamlessly integrates with Rust. It provides a modular and composable architecture, making it easy to build complex game systems and extend functionality as needed.
